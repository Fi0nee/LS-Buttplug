The **LS-Buttplug** project is designed to control vibrations of cheap Chinese sex toys that work with the **MuSe / Love Spouse** app.  
The goal of the project is to expand the functionality of available devices, since most cheap toys have limited software, and the **Love Spouse** app works with restrictions and failures in some regions.

The project supports 4 operation modes and provides smooth power control 0-9

## ⚠️ Issues and Notes
- Small vibration delays may occur when working with Intiface Central.  
- Works with the Lovense Remote app in offline mode. Sometimes it also works online, but only if you first turn off the internet, connect the device, and then turn the internet back on. Your toy may be disconnected at any time.

- If the device does not respond to commands, use the additional firmware to determine the HEX values [BLE-HEX-Picker](https://github.com/Fi0nee/BLE-HEX-Picker)

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Support for dual-channel devices (vibration/rotation, vibration/color)  
- ESP32 flashing via Web interface  
- Extended patterns or record/playback  
- Scheduled vibration
